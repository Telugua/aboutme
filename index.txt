ABHISHEK TELUGU

I am a first semester graduate student of Spring Batch 2019 working on my Masters of Applied Computer Science.

I am from Hyderabad, India. I have done my under-graduation in Civil Engineering from C.M.R College of Engineering and Technology. I worked for Amazon for almost 15 months as a Transaction Investigator. I am fond of Bikes and Cars and love racing.

My short term goal is to work for a company as a Full Stack Developer. After gaining sufficient experience in those fields, I want to be an Entrepreneur which is my long term goal.
